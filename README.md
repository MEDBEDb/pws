Installation
---
You can install pws with
`$ gem install pws`

Run `$ pws --help` for usage information.

On linux, please make sure you've got `xclip` or `xsel` installed for full clipboard support.


Updating from 0.9
---
You can try out the newest version with:
`$ gem install pws --pre`

The 0.9 password files are not compatible with that version, however, you can convert your safe with:
`$ pws resave --in 0.9 --out 1.0`


Reading the source
---
Trust the code by reading the source! It's originally based on [this tutorial](http://rbjl.net/41-tutorial-build-your-own-password-safe-with-ruby). You might want to start reading in the [0.9.2 tag](https://github.com/janlelis/pws/tree/0.9.2), because it's got less features and therefore is less code.
