pws is a command-line password safe/manager written in Ruby. Please run `pws help` for usage information.

The passwords normally get stored in ~/.pws. You can change this using the PWS environment variable.

Read the source! Based on: http://rbjl.net/41-tutorial-build-your-own-password-safe-with-ruby

Cucumber specs loosely based on https://github.com/thecatwasnot/passwordsafe/blob/master/features/add.feature by thecatwasnot - thanks.
